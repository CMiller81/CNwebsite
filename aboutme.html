    <p>Hello, my name is Chris Miller. I am 41 years old and I have been doing digital art 
    for about 5 years now. I started out by creating some simple 'Insignias' or 'Signatures',
    before I knew it, I was making desktop wallpapers. After some serious research into different workflows, I decided to create
    my own style, which is a combination of 'Photography', 'Paint' and 'Surreal' artwork
    ...this gave me so much flexability with the various mediums that were available to me.
    My particular interests in digital art are Surreal, Steampunk and Futurism.
    Other types would be texture art for things like 3D meshes etc.
